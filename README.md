# ALGE TIMY TIME CAPTURE UTILITY

Project in development.

### Goal:
- to demonstrate how to capture data (measured time) from the time measure device ALGE TIMY3
- show how to store it using SQLAlchemy ORM > SQLite3
- to provide basic command line interface


The Timy.py class is intended for further use in my other projects.
